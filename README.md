This software is a **RCON** (**R**emote **CON**sole) tool that allows you to control and manage multiple local and/or remote **Counter-Strike 2** game servers at same time using the TCP/IP-based **Source RCON protocol**.

In the past, a lot of RCON tools were published, maybe the most popular was **HLSW** but currently the project is abandoned and no updates are released. Some clones like **Source Admin Tool** tried to take over but most of them are outdated and doesn't support Counter-Strike 2 at 100%.

- **Source Admin Tool:** https://github.com/Drifter321/admintool

Seeing the lack of updated and functional tools to manage my own game servers i decided to code a new one by myself. I made a few intents to implement the **Source RCON protocol** and finally i build a library that is published in GitHub fut finally i decided to use a ripped and lightweigh version of another already built library made by an author called Untodesu because mine is buggy and needs a more deep testing.

## The Source RCON protocol
The **Source RCON Protocol** is a TCP/IP-based network communication protocol which allows to remotely send console commands to any Source-based game server. The most common use of the RCON protocol is to allow server owners to manage their game servers without direct access to the machine where the game server is running on.

In order for commands to be accepted, the connection between client and server must first be authenticated using the server's **RCON password**, which can be set up using a special console variable.

You can view more details of how the Source RCON protocol works here: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_RCON_Protocol
